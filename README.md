# Data Analysis Projects
This repository showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization, acquired through completing five projects as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis Certification.

# Projects
1.**Numpy Statistics**: Calculates the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a 3x3 numpy array.

2.**Demographic Analysis**: Uses pandas to analyze a demographic dataset and answer key questions. 

3.**Medical Data Visualization**: Analyzes medical data to obtain crucial patient information through visualizations such as catplots and heatmaps.

# Exercises
In addition to the projects above, the fibonacci.py file contains a series of beginner challenges that I undertook to improve my Python and problem-solving skills in programming.

# Skills Acquired
Through these projects, I gained experience in data discovery, preparation, and exploratory data analysis, including the visualization of data through various charts and graphs. I also acquired skills in data modeling, including the use of regression analysis to predict future trends based on available data.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I am eager to continue developing my skills in data analysis and visualization, and look forward to contributing to new projects in this field.
